# Full Capabilities Test Progress

## Test Configuration
- **Visual Features**: ENABLED
- **Intelligent OCR**: ENABLED  
- **LLM Detection**: ENABLED
- **Picture Classification**: ENABLED

## OCR Strategy Applied
The intelligent OCR strategy analyzed the 36-page document and decided:
- **2 high quality pages** - Likely boundary pages (first and last)
- **4 medium quality pages** - Context pages near boundaries
- **30 fast OCR pages** - Bulk pages with lower quality needs
- **0 skipped pages** - All pages need some level of processing

## Processing Performance (So Far)
- **Page 1**: 21.01s (High quality - EasyOCR with visual processing)
- **Pages 2-8**: ~3-7s each (Fast OCR with tesseract)
- **Page 9**: Tesseract parsing error, fallback to pytesseract
- **Page 10**: Tesseract parsing error, fallback to pytesseract
- **Pages 11-30**: ~3-10s each (Mix of fast and medium quality)

## Error Handling Success
- Successfully handled tesseract CSV parsing errors on pages 9 and 10
- Fallback to pytesseract worked correctly
- Processing continued without interruption

## Visual Feature Extraction
The system is now extracting visual features including:
- Layout structure analysis
- Font and style detection
- Color scheme analysis
- Header/footer patterns
- Logo and signature detection
- Whitespace patterns

## Expected Remaining Time
- Visual processing: ~2-3 minutes
- Boundary detection with LLM: ~5-10 minutes
- Total expected: ~10-15 minutes for 10 pages

## Key Observations
1. **Intelligent OCR is working**: Different pages getting different quality levels
2. **Error handling is robust**: Tesseract failures don't crash the system
3. **Processing time varies**: 3-21s per page depending on quality level
4. **Memory usage stable**: No signs of memory issues despite complex processing
